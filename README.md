#Sunset Detector

ProPublica has an awesome view of the sun setting over New Jersey. But, during the summer, no one stays late enough to tweet the sunset. SunsetDetector solves this tragic problem.

Sunsets tweeted most sunny nights at @propubsunset.

SunsetDetector is running on a Raspberry Pi with a cheap old webcam attached.

Roadmap:
* Soon, I'll implement a version of a SunsetDetector that asks Twitter followers to respond whether a tweeted picture is, in fact, a sunset. SunsetDetector will have a database keeping track of these votes to use them as groundtruth for a smarter, machine-learning based sunset detector.
